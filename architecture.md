# CAR11 Application Architecture Design

Based on the functional requirements, the CAR11 application will be designed using a three-tier architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## 1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- **Technology:** React.js
- **Purpose:**
    - Provide an intuitive, modern, and responsive user interface for both regular employees and administrators.
    - Handle user interactions and display data fetched from the backend API.
    - Implement client-side routing and state management.
    - Ensure cross-device compatibility (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Key Features:**
    - User authentication forms (login/logout).
    - Vehicle listing and detail views.
    - Reservation calendar and forms.
    - User and role management interfaces (admin).
    - Service and damage record management interfaces (admin).
    - Interactive dashboards and report visualizations (admin).

## 2. Application Layer (Backend)
- **Technology:** Flask (Python)
- **Purpose:**
    - Expose RESTful APIs for the frontend to consume.
    - Implement core business logic for vehicle management, reservations, user management, service records, and damage records.
    - Handle user authentication and authorization based on roles.
    - Interact with the database layer to store and retrieve data.
    - Implement data validation, error handling, and logging.
    - Generate reports and handle data exports (CSV).
- **Key Modules/Components:**
    - **Authentication Module:** User registration, login, logout, password hashing, token management.
    - **User Management Module:** CRUD operations for users and roles, permission checks.
    - **Vehicle Management Module:** CRUD operations for vehicles, availability checks, archiving.
    - **Reservation Management Module:** CRUD operations for reservations, calendar logic, conflict resolution.
    - **Maintenance Module:** CRUD operations for service and damage records, photo uploads.
    - **Reporting Module:** Logic for generating dashboard statistics, vehicle utilization, cost analysis, and reservation statistics.
    - **API Endpoints:** Define clear API contracts for all functionalities.

## 3. Data Layer (Database)
- **Technology:** SQLite (for simplicity in a demo/local environment, easily migratable to PostgreSQL for production)
- **Purpose:**
    - Persistently store all application data.
    - Ensure data integrity and consistency through proper schema design and transactional operations.
- **Key Entities (Tables):**
    - `Users`: Stores user details, hashed passwords, and role IDs.
    - `Roles`: Defines user roles and their permissions.
    - `Vehicles`: Stores vehicle details, status, and important dates.
    - `Reservations`: Stores reservation details, linked to users and vehicles.
    - `ServiceRecords`: Stores vehicle service history.
    - `DamageRecords`: Stores vehicle damage information, including paths to uploaded photos.

## Data Flow:
1. User interacts with the Frontend (React.js).
2. Frontend sends API requests to the Backend (Flask).
3. Backend processes the request, applies business logic, and interacts with the Database (SQLite).
4. Database returns data to the Backend.
5. Backend sends API responses back to the Frontend.
6. Frontend updates the UI based on the received data.

## Security Considerations:
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API authentication.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at the backend.
- **Password Security:** Hashing passwords using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
- **Input Validation:** Backend validation to prevent SQL Injection, XSS, etc.
- **HTTPS:** (Implicit for deployment) Secure communication between frontend and backend.

## Scalability and Maintainability:
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of concerns between layers and within backend modules.
- **RESTful APIs:** Standardized communication for easy integration and future expansion.
- **Containerization (Future):** Docker for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Version Control:** Git for collaborative development and change tracking.
